# Architecture

`atl` follows a hexagonal (ports & adapters) design: the domain defines
abstract interfaces; use-cases depend only on those interfaces; adapters
implement them; the CLI and any future server tier sit at the outermost ring
and are interchangeable transport layers.

cross-cutting (no import of adapters or CLI):
  internal/domain   — ports, Resource, Ref, sentinel errors
  internal/csf      — read-only CSF DOM parser + validator
  internal/fragment — opaque-fragment extraction + resolution
  internal/jiramap  — pure Jira snapshot → domain mapping
  internal/mirror   — on-disk layout + dirty/drift detection
  internal/diagnostic — stable transport-neutral error classes
  internal/selfupdate, internal/version

## Package reference

### `internal/domain`

The hub of the design. Every other package either implements or consumes
types from here; adapters and CLI never import each other.

**Ports**

`DocStore` is the backend interface for document stores (Confluence today):

```go
type DocStore interface {
    Search(ctx, query, limit, cursor) ([]PageRef, nextCursor, error)
    Tree(ctx, space, depth) ([]PageRef, error)
    GetPage(ctx, id, opts) (*Resource, error)
    GetMeta(ctx, id) (*PageMeta, error)
    History(ctx, id) ([]Version, error)
    UpdatePage(ctx, id, expectVersion, title, body, force) (newVersion, error)
    CreatePage(ctx, space, parent, title, body) (*Resource, error)
    MovePage(ctx, id, newParent, expectVersion, title, body) (newVersion, error)
    DeletePage(ctx, id) error
    ListComments / AddComment / ListAttachments / DownloadAttachment
}
```

`Tracker` is the backend interface for issue trackers (Jira today):

```go
type Tracker interface {
    GetIssue / Search / Create / Update / Transition
    AddComment / Link / LinkEpic
    ListAttachments / DownloadAttachment
    Fields / FieldOptions / Transitions / LinkTypes
}
```

Adding a new backend (Notion, Linear, GitLab Issues) means writing a struct
that satisfies one of these interfaces; no other package changes.

**Optional capability ports.** Some features are not part of every backend's
surface, so they live in their own narrow interfaces rather than bloating the
core port — a backend implements them only if it can, and the service composes
the same adapter instance across several capability fields (as
`ConfluenceService` does with `store`/`users`/`assets`/`verifier`):

- `Verifier` (`Whoami`) — confirms a PAT before `auth login` persists it.
- `Agile` (`Boards`/`Board`/`Sprints`/`Sprint`/`SprintIssues`/
  `MoveIssuesToSprint`/`MoveIssuesToBacklog`) — Jira Software boards & sprints
  over the Data Center Agile API `/rest/agile/1.0/`. Requires GreenHopper, so a
  Jira Core/Service-Management-only instance (or a future non-agile tracker)
  simply omits it.

**Registry ports (in `registry.go`)**

`AssetSink` — the mirror hands this to fragment handlers so they can write
fetched asset bytes to the correct on-disk path without knowing the layout.

`AssetResolver` — fetches the rendered bytes of a visual fragment (draw.io
PNG at a specific revision, inline image) from the backend. The Confluence
adapter implements it; the fragment package consumes it.

`UserResolver` — a function type `func(ctx, userkey) (string, error)` that
maps an opaque Confluence userkey to a display name. Passed as a closure so
the caller can substitute a stub for tests.

**Core types**

`Resource` is the unified unit shared by the mirror and both service layers:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ID` | backend id (Confluence content-id or Jira issue key) |
| `Title` | page/issue title |
| `SpaceKey` | Confluence space key or Jira project key |
| `Version` | backend version, used as the optimistic-lock gate |
| `Body` | native-format bytes (CSF or Jira wiki) — never converted |
| `Hash` | sha256 of `Body` — drives dirty detection |
| `Refs` | resolved opaque fragments (draw.io, users, links, images) |
| `Ancestors` | ancestor titles top→down — drives the mirror folder path |

`Ref` is a resolved opaque fragment (see [csf-and-fragments.md](csf-and-fragments.md)):

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `Kind` | `drawio` / `user` / `attachment` / `page-link` / `image` |
| `Key` | raw backend key (userkey, filename, diagram name, page title) |
| `Display` | human-readable label after resolution |
| `Asset` | relative path to a fetched render file (PNG, etc.) |
| `Params` | handler-specific extras (e.g. `revision` for draw.io) |

**Sentinel errors**

Sentinel errors in `errors.go` are the sole way the CLI layer learns what
exit code to use:

| sentinel | exit code | cause |
|---|---|---|
| `ErrAuth` | 3 | 401 from the backend |
| `ErrNotFound` | 4 | 404 from the backend |
| `ErrVersionConflict` | 5 | 409 / optimistic-lock refused |
| `ErrForbidden` | 6 | 403 from the backend |
| `ErrUsage` | 2 | bad CLI arguments or state |

All adapter errors wrap one of these via `fmt.Errorf("%w: ...", domain.ErrXxx)`;
`errors.Is` in the CLI layer unwraps them to the right exit code.

---

### `internal/adapter/confluence`

Implements `domain.DocStore`, `domain.AssetResolver`, and exports
`ResolveUser` (matching the `domain.UserResolver` signature).

- Uses `internal/httpx.Client` for all HTTP — bearer PAT auth, retries, host
  verification, and status→sentinel error mapping.
- `GetPage` fetches either `body.storage` (CSF bytes) or `body.view` (rendered
  HTML) depending on `PullOpts.Format`. Bodies are passed verbatim to callers;
  the adapter never converts them.
- `UpdatePage` implements the optimistic version gate: it sends
  `version.number = expectVersion + 1`; Confluence returns 409 (mapped to
  `ErrVersionConflict`) if the remote has moved past `expectVersion`. The
  `force` flag re-reads the current version and targets `current + 1` instead,
  bypassing the gate.
- `Resolve` (implements `AssetResolver`) downloads draw.io PNGs via
  `/download/attachments/<pageID>/<name>.png?version=<rev>` for the exact
  diagram revision captured at pull time, and fetches inline images by
  filename.
- `ResolveUser` tries `/rest/api/user?key=` then `/rest/api/user?accountId=`
  to cover both Data Center (userkey) and Cloud (account-id) styles.

### `internal/adapter/jira`

Implements `domain.Tracker` against the Jira REST v2 API.

Raw Jira field maps are converted by the transport-neutral `internal/jiramap`
package. The REST adapter and offline renderer share that mapper without making
ordinary app use-cases import transport code.

- `Transition` resolves the target status by name (case-insensitive) against
  the live list from `/transitions`, so callers pass human names rather than
  numeric IDs.
- `LinkEpic` discovers the custom field id for "Epic Link" at runtime (DC
  classic boards); warns gracefully if the field is absent.
- `FieldOptions` uses the `createmeta` endpoint to enumerate allowed values
  for a field on a specific project/issue-type pair, which agents need before
  setting dropdowns.

---

### `internal/csf`

A read-only DOM parser for Confluence Storage Format. See
[csf-and-fragments.md](csf-and-fragments.md) for the full write-path safety
argument. Key types:

- `Node` — DOM node with `Type` (Element / Text / CData), `Name`
  (namespace-prefix + local), `Attr`, `Children`, `Data`.
- `Parse(raw []byte) (*Node, error)` — wraps raw bytes in a synthetic `<root>`
  element so body fragments (which may have multiple top-level nodes) parse as
  a single document; configures `xml.HTMLEntity` so `&nbsp;`, `&mdash;`, etc.
  resolve; returns an error for malformed XML.
- `Walk(n, fn)` — depth-first traversal; `fn` returns false to skip a
  subtree.
- `TextContent(n)` — concatenated text of a subtree.
- `Validate(raw []byte) []Problem` — runs well-formedness first (returns a
  single error problem with accurate line/col if the XML is broken), then runs
  sanity checks (advisory warnings: macros without `ac:name`, draw.io without
  `diagramName`, dangling `ri:attachment` refs).
- `Problem` carries `Severity` (`"error"` / `"warning"`), `Line`, `Col`,
  `Rule`, `Message`. `HasErrors` reports whether any problem blocks a push.

---

### `internal/fragment`

Extracts and resolves the opaque fragments embedded in a CSF DOM.

`Extract(root *csf.Node) []domain.Ref` — walks the DOM and returns distinct
refs in document order, deduplicated by `(kind, key)`. Recognized patterns:

| CSF construct | `RefKind` | `Key` |
|---|---|---|
| `<ac:structured-macro ac:name="drawio">` | `drawio` | `diagramName` param |
| `<ac:image>` containing `<ri:attachment>` | `image` | `ri:filename` |
| `<ri:user ri:userkey="…">` | `user` | userkey or account-id |
| `<ri:page ri:content-title="…">` | `page-link` | content-title |
| `<ri:attachment ri:filename="…">` | `attachment` | filename |

`Resolve(ctx, page, refs, deps) []domain.Ref` — mutates each ref's `Display`
and `Asset`:

- `drawio` / `image`: calls `deps.Resolver.Resolve` → `deps.Assets.Put` to
  fetch and save the render; on failure leaves the ref with its raw display
  and no asset path.
- `user`: calls `deps.Users(ctx, key)` to get a display name; caches results
  per-call to avoid duplicate round-trips; degrades to `@key` on failure.
- `page-link` / `attachment`: no network call needed; already human-readable.

All failure paths are swallowed — `Resolve` never returns an error. The
fragment layer is extension-friendly: adding a new opaque type (Mermaid,
PlantUML, LaTeX) means extending `Extract`'s switch; adding a network-fetched
render means implementing `AssetResolver.Resolve` for that kind.

---

### `internal/mirror`

Owns the on-disk layout of the mirror directory. It is backend-agnostic; it
stores `domain.Resource` bytes and knows nothing about HTTP or CSF semantics.

**On-disk layout**

```
mirror/
  SPACE/
    ancestor-title/
      page-title/
        page-title.csf        ← source of truth (verbatim CSF bytes)
        page-title.md         ← read-view (best-effort; lossy by design)
        page-title.meta.json  ← id, title, version, content_hash, fragments
        page-title.assets/
          diagram-name.png    ← resolved draw.io PNG (with --assets)
          photo.jpg           ← resolved inline image (with --assets)
  .atl/
    state.json                ← sidecar: last-synced version + hash per id
    base/
      <id>.csf                ← pristine copy of body at last sync
  .gitignore                  ← auto-created; excludes .atl/, *.pat, etc.
```

**Key operations**

- `PageDir(space, ancestors, title)` — computes the directory path using a
  `slugify` function that preserves unicode letters and digits (Cyrillic
  included), lowercases, and collapses everything else to hyphens, truncated
  at 80 runes.
- `ClaimPageDir(space, ancestors, title, id)` — the collision-aware wrapper
  writers go through. Slugification is lossy (`Foo Bar` and `Foo-Bar?` both
  slugify to `foo-bar`), so before handing out a dir it checks the existing
  `<slug>.meta.json`: a dir owned by a different page id (or holding page
  files with unreadable meta) diverts the newcomer to an id-suffixed slug
  (`foo-bar-200`), sticky across re-pulls even if the plain dir later frees
  up; if even that dir belongs to someone else the claim refuses
  (`ErrCheckFailed`) rather than overwrite. Known limitation: ancestor path
  segments are still title-derived and collision-blind (ancestor ids are not
  available), so descendants of a diverted page nest under the plain-slug
  ancestor dir — structurally off, but no file is ever overwritten because
  every leaf claim disambiguates.
- `Write(dir, slug, page, refs)` — writes all four artefacts and updates the
  sidecar; the markdown view is best-effort (it never fails a pull) but may
  never contradict the source of truth: an unparseable body overwrites the
  previous revision's `.md` with an explicit "view unavailable" stub, and a
  failed `.md` write falls back to removing the stale file. How the
  CSF→Markdown view is tested and how to extend its coverage:
  [docs/csf-markdown-testing.md](csf-markdown-testing.md).
- `LoadCSF(path)` — reads a `.csf` file, its `.meta.json`, and the sidecar
  entry; computes `Dirty = currentHash != syncedHash`.
- `ListCSF()` — walks the tree (skipping `.atl/`), loads every `.csf`, sorts
  by path. Walk, body, and metadata errors fail the scan; no entry is silently
  omitted from status or a directory push.
- `LoadWiki(path)` / `ListWiki()` — the Jira analogs over `.wiki` substrate
  files. There is no neighboring `.meta.json`, so the sidecar key is the issue
  key (the file's basename); dirty detection is otherwise identical. Walk and
  body errors likewise fail the scan.
- `SaveBaseExt(id, body, ext)` / `BaseBodyExt(id, ext)` — the ext-aware base
  store; the plain `saveBase`/`BaseBody` are the `.csf` specialization. Jira
  records its pristine base under `.atl/base/<KEY>.wiki`. `SyncBatch.Record`
  lets a backend that writes its own substrate files (Jira's `.wiki`) share the
  batch's single sidecar load/save without going through `writePageFiles`.
- Sidecar (`state.json`) tracks `{id, version, hash, path}` per page. Mirror
  directories and files are accessed through Go's root-scoped filesystem API.
  Intermediate descendant symlinks are rejected; reads reject a final symlink,
  while atomic writes replace it without following it. The selected root itself
  remains the caller's trust anchor. Saves use temp + fsync + root-scoped rename, so a
  crash can never leave a half-written file. A corrupt sidecar is a loud
  error on every path that consults it (`status`, `push`, `pull`) — never a
  silent reset to "never synced", which would quietly disable drift
  detection. Multi-page writes go through `BeginSync`/`SyncBatch.Write`/
  `Flush` so a pull loads the file once, and `ListCSF` loads it once for the
  whole walk. On flush, each batch acquires the backend-neutral
  `.atl/state.lock`, re-reads the latest sidecar, and merges only the page/view
  entries it changed before the atomic save. This prevents Jira and Confluence
  processes sharing one root from overwriting each other's state; contention
  fails closed instead of silently disabling drift detection. The `base/`
  directory stores pristine body copies so `push` can diff
  fragments without a network round-trip.

---

### `internal/app`

Transport-agnostic use-cases. `ConfluenceService` and `JiraService` are
assembled in `wire.go` by wiring the config-loaded URL + PAT-resolved adapter
and storing it behind the port interface. This layer is what a hypothetical
future HTTP server tier would also call — no cobra, no stdin, no filesystem
beyond explicit storage use-cases. The app layer orchestrates filesystem-backed
use-cases through `internal/mirror`, `internal/safepath`, and narrow helpers;
`internal/mirror` owns layout, sidecar, baseline, and dirty/drift primitives.
Plan inputs, exports, manifests, attachments, and caller-selected output files
use bounded/atomic I/O where applicable.

Notable behaviors:

- `Pull` resolves page IDs from `--id` / `--cql` / `--space`, fetches each
  page in CSF format, runs `fragment.Extract` + `fragment.Resolve`, and calls
  `mirror.Write`. Ordinary mode caps CQL at 1 000 and space tree at 2 000;
  explicit complete mode qualifies an exhaustive selector twice and consumes
  a private resumable exact-id checkpoint.
- `Push` validates CSF (`csf.HasErrors` → refuse), computes a fragment diff
  against the pristine base, then calls `store.UpdatePage` under the version
  gate; on success it re-fetches and refreshes the mirror entry.
- `Status` walks the mirror's `.csf` files, compares hashes, and optionally
  fires one `GetMeta` per page to detect remote drift.
- `JiraService.Images` downloads only `image/*`-typed attachments; the others
  are skipped.
- `JiraService.Pull` exports each issue as three files under
  `mirror-jira/<PROJECT>/`: `<KEY>.wiki` (the native Jira wiki body, byte-for-byte
  — the editable substrate, mirroring `.csf`'s role for Confluence), `<KEY>.md`
  (a best-effort derived Markdown staging view rendered from the wiki by
  `internal/wikimd`, regenerated on every pull — a render failure degrades one
  section to a stub, never failing the pull), and `<KEY>.json` (raw fields
  snapshot). The `.md` `path` is what the pull result reports. The pull also
  records the `.wiki` body in the sidecar plus a `.atl/base/<KEY>.wiki` base
  copy so the write-back cycle can detect edits and drift. `.md` Description
  edits are merged into `.wiki` by `jira apply`; typed rich-text field sections
  explicitly configured editable are staged under `.atl/pending/jira/`. The raw
  `.json` snapshot and assets remain read-only until a successful push refreshes
  the snapshot.
  `internal/wikiscanner` owns the Jira heading/macro/hr/list/table recognition
  rules consumed by both `wikimd` and `wikimerge`, so renderer and apply block
  boundaries cannot drift through duplicated regular expressions.

Confluence path relocation is id-based rather than directory-based. A re-pull
reconstructs the recorded pristine view in `app`, while `mirror` hash-binds and
retires only the old page's primary artifacts after the replacement sidecar
path is durable. State lookup also requires path identity, so a crash-left old
copy is untracked/dirty. Descendant and auxiliary directories are never removed
recursively.
  Pending commits bind the recorded sidecar path and reviewed `.wiki` hash. A
  non-discoverable transaction is published only after the atomic wiki write;
  status/push recover an interrupted commit from its before/after hashes.
  A stable mirror-global advisory lock inode serializes Jira mirror mutations
  through sidecar flush; atomically replacing `.wiki` cannot bypass that lock.
- `JiraService.Status` walks the mirror's `.wiki` files and pending-field state,
  compares hashes (`locally_edited`), and with `--remote` fires one `GetIssue` per issue,
  comparing the remote description/fields to stored bases (`remote_drifted`); a file
  with no sidecar entry reads never-synced (`synced:false`).
- `JiraService.Push` is the guarded write-back. It is **dry-run by default**
  (`--apply` to write) because Jira has **no server-side version gate**: the
  staleness guard is an app-layer compare-and-swap — a fresh remote read is
  compared to pristine bases, and a mismatch is refused as `ErrCheckFailed`
  (exit 8), **never** `ErrVersionConflict` (#66). `--force` may override only
  Description drift; pending fields always fail closed. Description and the
  explicit pending field set are sent in one typed update. Ambiguous responses
  are reconciled by a fresh end-state read without replay; retry also treats
  remote==proposal as already applied and repairs local state only. Definitive
  4xx errors are not reconciled, and backend response bodies are sanitized. A server-side HTTP
  409 stays a generic conflict. On `--apply` success it re-fetches and refreshes
  `.wiki`/`.md`/`.json`/base/sidecar and clears pending state. Transport/local
  refresh failures are warnings; a successful verification read whose values
  mismatch the full proposal retains pending and returns `ErrCheckFailed`.

---

### `internal/profile`

Owns the versioned private workflow profile independently of backend adapters
and mirrors. It strictly decodes and normalizes schema facts, confirmed user
preferences, explicitly sourced team policy, render defaults, and named
selectors. Canonical JSON hashes drive a two-phase preview/apply contract;
apply rechecks both candidate and current hashes under a config-root advisory
lock, then atomically replaces `profile.json` with mode 0600. The package never
reads Atlassian content or applies runtime render config—those consent decisions
remain in the onboarding skill/CLI orchestration.

Learning uses two more owner-only artifacts without weakening that boundary.
Versioned observations deterministically build a hash-bound suggestion; review
reuses the normal profile preview and apply guards, while rejection retains only
the suggestion hash. Revalidation state records explicit verified/missing/failed
metadata checks separately from the last verified profile fact. No background
reader, clock-based mutation, or policy inference exists; callers supply an
absolute stale cutoff and approved read results.

### `internal/cli`

The cobra command tree. Commands are thin:

1. Parse flags.
2. Call one use-case method.
3. Render via `emit(cmd, value, textFn)` — JSON by default; text when
   `-o text` and a `textFn` is provided.
4. Return an error; `codeFor(err)` maps it to the process exit code via
   `errors.Is` against the domain sentinels.

`PersistentPreRun` on the root command calls `runSelfUpdate` before every
subcommand. The cobra `SilenceUsage` and `SilenceErrors` flags are set so the
CLI's own error message is the only output on stderr.

---

### `internal/httpx`

Shared HTTP infrastructure used by both adapters. Features:

- Bearer auth (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) injected automatically, but
  only when the request host matches the configured backend host — server-
  supplied attachment URLs pointing elsewhere do not receive the PAT.
- Three retries with exponential backoff (200 ms → 400 ms → 800 ms, capped at
  5 s) for replay-safe reads (`GET`/`HEAD`) on 429 and 5xx responses; honours
  `Retry-After`. Writes are never retried generically after an ambiguous
  response and must reconcile at the endpoint/use-case layer.
- Status → sentinel: 401 → `ErrAuth`, 403 → `ErrForbidden`, 404 →
  `ErrNotFound`, 409 → `ErrVersionConflict`.
- `GetJSON`, `SendJSON` convenience wrappers; `GetStream` for binary
  downloads — retries apply until the 2xx headers arrive, then the body
  streams (never buffered in httpx) bounded by an inactivity deadline instead
  of the JSON client's whole-request timeout, so large transfers on slow
  links are limited by stalls, not total wall-clock.

---

### `internal/auth`

PAT resolution for `confluence` and `jira`. Resolution order (first non-empty
wins):

1. `ATL_CONFLUENCE_PAT` / `CONFLUENCE_PAT` / `TEST_CONFLUENCE_PAT` (env)
2. `ATL_JIRA_PAT` / `JIRA_PAT` / `TEST_JIRA_PAT` (env)
3. `~/.config/atl/credentials.json` (keyed by service name, mode 0600)

`auth.Login` writes to the credentials file. `auth.Source` reports where a
token was found without revealing it (used by `atl auth status`).

---

### `internal/config`

Non-secret settings. `Config` holds `ConfluenceURL`, `JiraURL`,
`UpdateBaseURL`. Config directory resolution:

1. `ATL_CONFIG_DIR` env
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/atl`
3. `~/.config/atl`

`Load` reads `config.json` then overlays env vars (`ATL_CONFLUENCE_URL` /
`CONFLUENCE_URL`, `ATL_JIRA_URL` / `JIRA_URL`, `ATL_UPDATE_URL`); env always
wins.

---

### `internal/selfupdate` and `internal/version`

See [self-update.md](self-update.md) for the full description.

`version.Version`, `version.Commit`, and `version.BuildState` are injected via
`-ldflags` by supported Makefile/release builds. `version.Current` falls back to
Go compiler VCS settings for unstamped builds and normalizes unavailable
provenance to `unknown`; no build timestamp is embedded. The commit/state are
diagnostic only and do not participate in update trust.
`version.DefaultUpdateURL` bakes the GitHub Releases download base into the
binary.

### `internal/mcpserver`

The stdio MCP transport registers a closed remote-read-only tool inventory and
calls `JiraService`/`ConfluenceService` methods directly. It never shells back
into Cobra. Production dependencies are lazy per service/tool call so a missing
Jira configuration does not suppress Confluence tools, and vice versa. The
server shares `internal/diagnostic` classifications with CLI errors while MCP
and CLI retain their transport-specific envelopes.

The explicit registration list is the security boundary. There is no generic
command dispatcher, raw REST tool, mutation, arbitrary filesystem access, or
mirror-writing tool. See [mcp.md](mcp.md) for the public inventory and bounds.

## Extension points

| extension | what to do |
|---|---|
| New document backend (Notion, GitHub Wiki) | Implement `domain.DocStore` in a new `internal/adapter/<name>` package; add a `New<Name>` wiring function in `internal/app/wire.go`. |
| New issue tracker (Linear, GitLab Issues) | Implement `domain.Tracker` in a new adapter package; wire analogously. |
| New opaque fragment type (Mermaid, PlantUML) | Add a case in `fragment.Extract`'s `Walk` callback; add a `Resolve` handler in the `AssetResolver` adapter if the fragment renders to a file. |
| New MCP evidence tool | Add an explicit typed wrapper around an existing read-only app use-case, define hard context bounds, annotate it accurately, and extend the exact inventory/security tests. Do not expose CLI dispatch or raw REST. |
| OS-keychain auth backend | Replace `loadStore`/`saveStore` in `internal/auth` with a keychain call; `Token` / `Login` / `Logout` signatures stay the same. |
